A SLEIGH processor spec for [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) for the XpertTeak DSP used on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.

## Installation

This repository should be placed within the Ghidra install as the folder `Ghidra/Processors/XpertTeak`, such that `Ghidra/Processors/XpertTeak/data` is the path to the `data` folder.  Ghidra should automatically add it to the available processor list on its next start, and compile the files when it is first used.
